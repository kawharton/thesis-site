      <h2 class="intro lora" id="top-p"> More than 35 million people suffer from Alzheimer&#39;s disease, with rates predicted to double every 20 years due to the aging world population.</h2>
        <p>Without a known cause for Alzheimer's disease, there is no guaranteed way to prevent it. Researchers are currently looking into ways to decrease the likelihood of getting Alzheimer&#39;s disease, but studies have not yet shown that lifestyle factors can prevent or slow the illness.</p>
        <h2 class="intro lora">Recent research indicates that major depressive disorder is a risk factor for Alzheimer&#39;s disease. </h2> 
        <p> This is important, because it has been estimated that at least 350 million people worldwide suffer at least one depressive episode in their lifetime. In addition, over the next 20 years, depression is projected to be the leading cause of disability in high-income nations.</p>
        <h2 class="intro lora">Research suggests that both disorders have a significant connection to the <span>default mode network (DMN)</span>.</h2>
          <p>The DMN is a neural network that is activated when a person is engaged in internal thinking tasks such as daydreaming. When a person is performing an activity that requires attention, the DMN is not activated.</p>

In its early stages, Alzheimer&#39;s disease is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, confusion, and irritability, but as the disease progresses, an individual becomes less able to care for him or herself, relying on the assistance of caregivers to help perform daily tasks including eating and bathing. <br>

          <h4>Alzheimer's Disease and the DMN</h4>
      <p>The DMN of a brain affected by Alzheimer&#39;s disease has an abundance of amyloid plaques. Recent studies suggest that hyperactivity in the DMN leads to an accumulation of plaques in this region.</p>

Other symptoms include, but are not limited to, insomnia, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, physical aches, irritability, changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, and rumination.<br>

          <h4>Major Depressive Disorder and the DMN</h4>
          <p>In those suffering from MDD, the default mode network is overactive, possibly explaining the high amount of rumination and negative thought processes associated with the illness. This overactivation might lead to the difficulty concentrating that people with depression experience.</p>

      <div class="capture"> <h3 class="lora title">The DMN and Meditation</h3>Decreasing the activity of the DMN may be beneficial in lowering the prevalence of major depression, and in turn, possibly that of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Meditation, a practice aimed at calming the mind through the focusing of attention, has been shown to be effective in decreasing DMN activity. Meditative practices are increasingly being used to treat major depression. <br>

      <p>Although there is increased understanding of the link between the DMN and these disorders within the scientific community, the general public remains largely unaware of this research and its implications.
        Because of the key role that the DMN plays in both of these disorders, and the possibility of leveraging this network to offset or mitigate the risks of these disorders, public education is a top priority. I have, therefore, created a website to explain the DMN, its link to depression and Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and methods that people can adopt to change the activity of the DMN and perhaps reduce their risk for these devastating disorders.</p>
