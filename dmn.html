          <section id="dmn-intro">
      <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The default mode network (DMN) is a neural network involved in self-relevant thinking. It plays a role in constructing mental simulations based on personal experiences such as:</p>
            <ul class="ul-list">
              <li>&#183; Remembering the past</li>
            <li>&#183; Thinking about the future</li>
            <li>&#183; Considering the perspective of another</li>
            <li>&#183; Making moral judgments</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding the behavior of the DMN involves comprehension of two types of brain activity: task positive (TP) and task negative (TN). Task positive activities are goal-oriented and require attention, whereas task negative activities are freethinking and involve internal mentation. In simple terms, task-negative activity can be described as daydreaming. Evidence suggests that the DMN is activated during task negative situations and shut off during task-positive activities.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">In order to study the DMN, researchers assign subjects a task and use brain-imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and PET scans to determine which regions of the brain are activated. Although the researchers are assigning tasks (which could make one consider the studies to be TP), these exercises are actually mental simulations that a person might think about while freethinking and are therefore, TN activity.</p>
            <h3>Tasks Used to Study the DMN</h3>
            <p class="bold">&#183; Autobiographical Memory</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">For studies about autobiographical memory, subjects are asked to recall specific personal episodes from their past. For example, one may be asked to retrieve a vivid memory about an experience with a childhood best friend.</p>
            <p class="bold padding-top-remove">&#183; Future Prospection</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">For studies in which researchers encourage subjects to think about the future, participants are cued to think about an item, such as a ring, and then to imagine a future event involving the item. In one such study, when cued to think about a future event involving a dress, a participant imagined the following:
              
              <blockquote>
               <p> My sister will be finishing her undergraduate education&#8230;And I can see myself sitting in some kind of sundress, like yellow, and under some trees.</p>
               
                </blockquote> 
           <p class="author">(Addis et al. 2007)</p>
            
            
            <p class="bold padding-top-remove">&#183; Theory of Mind</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">In order to perform studies involving theory of mind, thinking about the beliefs and intentions of other people, researchers ask subjects to answer questions that require one to think from another person&#39;s perspective. For example the following scenario requires the ability to think from the perspective of the character, Max: </p>
<blockquote><p>Max eats half his chocolate bar and puts the rest away in the kitchen cupboard. He then goes out to play in the sun. Meanwhile, Max&#39;s mother comes into the kitchen, opens the cupboard and sees the chocolate bar. She puts it in the fridge. When Max comes back into the kitchen, where does he look for his chocolate bar: in the cupboard, or in the fridge?</p></blockquote> 
            
            <p class="author">(Wimmer &amp; Perner, 1983)</p>

            <p class="bold padding-top-remove">&#183; Moral Judgments</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">The DMN also supports moral decision-making. Researchers studying moral decision-making provide participants with hypothetical situations requiring an evaluation of whether an action taken was moral or immoral. For example, individuals might be asked to consider if it is morally acceptable for him or her to push one person off a sinking boat in order to save five other people.</p>
            <h3>Brain regions</h3>
            <p>There are a number of brain regions that are consistently identified as being part of the default mode network. In addition, some research suggests the involvement of other brain regions, but there is not universal agreement on this. <br><br>Some key regions of the DMN include: </p>
            <ul class="ul-list">
            <li><span class="bold">Subgenual Cingulate:</span> The subgenual cingulate is a key region in the study and treatment of depression. It connects directly to the amygdala, which mediates the fear response and emotional memory, and to the hypothalamus, which is integral in the stress response. </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Posterior Cingulate Cortex: </span> The posterior cingulate cortex plays an important role in attention and internally focused cognition. </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Medial Temporal Lobe:</span> The medial temporal lobe consists of structures important for memory, including the hippocampus.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Thalamus:</span> The thalamus relays information from subcortical brain regions to the cortex. It also plays a role in processing self-referential thoughts and emotions. </li>
            </ul>

      <h2 class="heading">Role in Major Depression</h2>
          <p>Mind-wandering. Daydreaming. Fantasizing. We all do it. Research suggests that people mind-wander 10-15% of their wakeful hours. In individuals with depression, however, mind-wandering tends to take on a more destructive, ruminative form. Rumination is a repetitive, passive, self-reflective focus on symptoms of distress and their possible causes and consequences. Because mind-wandering engages areas of the DMN, and rumination is a form of mind-wandering, much research involving the DMN and depression has focused on rumination. A ruminative response style in people with depression has been shown to predict higher levels of depressive symptoms. This might occur due to an increased allocation of neural resources to the recall and rehearsal of negative life events.</p>
          <h3>Subgenual Cingulate Cortex (SCC, Area 25)</h3>
          <p>Research suggests that the DMN functional connectivity in depression is highly driven by the subgenual cingulate activity. Increased functional connectivity of the subgenual cingulate is associated with increased length of depressive episode. In depressed subjects, the subgenual cingulate has been shown to have an increased metabolism and reduced volume. The severity of depression correlates positively with metabolism in the subgenual cingulate.</p>
          <p class="padding-top-remove">In a study in which participants performed a period of short-term memory tasks, each followed by a period of rest, it was determined that subgenual cingulate hyperconnectivity of participants with depression occurred only during rest periods, which are presumably when rumination occurs. Connectivity in healthy controls and in subjects with depression did not differ during task periods. Thus, subgenual cingulate hyperconnectivity may be the neural substrate for rumination. Because this depressive neural pattern does not occur during the memory task, hyperconnectivity in the subgenual cingulate in individuals with depression can be attenuated by giving people something specific to think about, possibly relieving rumination and improving mood.</p>
          <p class="padding-top-remove">It has also been observed that the metabolism in these regions declines toward the normal range among individuals who respond to treatment. In a study in which six individuals with treatment-resistant depression received deep brain stimulation of the white matter tracts leading the subgenual cingulate, the four patients who responded positively to the treatment exhibited decreased metabolism in the region.</p>
          <p class="padding-top-remove">In a similar study, in which 20 individuals with treatment-resistant depression received deep brain stimulation of the subgenual cingulate, 60% of patients had responded to treatment by six months, with 35% in remission, providing further evidence for the role of the DMN in depressive rumination.</p>
          <h3>Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)</h3>
          <p>A second region shown to play a significant role in major depression is the posterior cingulate. The posterior cingulate has been shown to display hypometabolism in this population. Much research has explored the relationship between the posterior cingulate and the subgenual cingulate in subjects with depression.  A common finding in studies is that during resting states, in which one is left to his or her own thoughts, the activity in the posterior cingulate is highly-correlated to the activity of the subgenual cingulate in subjects with depression, but not in normal control subjects. Research suggests that this increased connectivity between the posterior cingulate and subgenual cingulate is related to rumination.</p>
          <p class="padding-top-remove">During task periods, in which subjects are given a specific task to complete, the brains of subjects with depression were similar those of normal controls, in that there was no correlation between the activity of the subgenual cingulate and the posterior cingulate. A lack of connectivity between the subgenual cingulate and posterior cingulate during task periods might suggest that distraction helps to decrease rumination, which could in turn, improve depressive symptoms.</p>
          <h3>Thalamus</h3>
          <p>The thalamus is another region in the DMN that plays a significant role in MDD. Studies suggest that the thalamus of individuals with depression displays hypermetabolism, as well as a specific pattern of functional connectivity. There is increased connectivity between the thalamus to the affect-related subgenual cingulate, but decreased connectivity to more cognitive regions of the anterior cingulate. In patients who are successfully treated for depression, all three of these characteristics return to normal levels.</p>
          <h3>Other regions associated with the DMN and MDD</h3>
          <p class="bottom-padding-remove">The subgenual cingulate, the posterior cingulate and the thalamus are three main regions in the DMN that are linked to MDD. There are also other regions in the DMN that may play a role in negative mood, although not to the same extent. For example, the brains of individuals with depression often experience hypometabolism in the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate. Although the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate primarily play a role in cognition, there is some evidence that they are also involved in emotion and depression.</p>

          <h2 class="heading">Role in Alzheimer&#39;s Disease</h2>
         <p>Although the DMN is primarily thought to play a role in major depression, there is also emerging evidence that damage in this network may play a role in AD. Research has shown that the DMN of individuals with AD is vulnerable to glucose hypometabolism, atrophy, and amyloid plaques. Amyloid plaques are a hallmark feature of Alzheimer&#39;s disease and cause a specific pattern of disruption. Brain regions that make up the DMN overlap with areas consumed by a high concentration of amyloid plaques. In a study in which mice were genetically-engineered to accumulate amyloid plaques within the brain, researchers discovered that higher levels of soluble amyloid-beta and increased plaque development are found in regions of increased neuronal activity. The researchers determined that with increased activity, the levels of amyloid plaques increase in size and quantity, whereas when activity levels are decreased, the growth and development of new plaques is inhibited.           
</p>
            <h3>Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) and Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL)</h3>
            <p>During a resting state, the PCC is one of the most metabolically active regions of the brain in healthy controls. In the brains of individuals with AD, however, decreased activity of the PCC is one of the most common findings during brain imaging. The PCC has also been found to have the greatest amyloid-beta load, along with the medial frontal cortex.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Studies have demonstrated that the PCC is highly connected to medial temporal lobe structures, such as the hippocampus, which is important for memory. Both the PCC and the MTL display hypometabolism in the brain of individuals with AD. With the MTL being one of the first regions that AD affects, it has been hypothesized that the decreased activity of the MTL leads to a decreased connectivity between this region and the PCC, therefore causing a lower level of metabolic activity in the PCC. This decrease in connectivity is likely the basis of decline in memory.</p>
            <h3>Medial Frontal Lobe</h3>
            <p>The medial frontal lobe has one of the highest amyloid-beta loads in the brain of AD individuals. Interestingly, one structure included in this region is the subgenual cingulate, an important structure for MDD pathology. </p>

            <h3>What is meditation?</h3>
            <p>There are times at which we are unaware of what is presently happening, both internally and in our surrounding environment. When this happens, one is said to be &#8220;zoned out&#8221; or daydreaming. In this state of mind, thoughts tend to focus on negative situations rather than positive ones. Excessive rumination, negative thoughts about past experiences, and excessive worry about the future are associated with activation of the DMN, as well as with depression and anxiety.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Researchers have discovered that practicing meditation, rather than being enveloped with thoughts or worries of the past or future, increases overall happiness in life.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Meditation is a practice aimed at calming the mind through the focusing of attention. There are two main styles of meditation, concentrative and mindfulness. Concentrative meditations involve focusing on a single particular object, whereas mindfulness meditations involve focusing on the present moment and an open monitoring of attention to all sensations, thoughts and emotions. Examples of concentrative meditation include focusing on a candle flame, listening to a repetitive sound, or repeating a single word or phrase. Mindfulness meditation can be performed by a progressive body relaxation exercise, for example, in which one starts at his or her feet and slowly relaxes every part of the body up to the head.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Mindfulness meditation, in particular, has been used extensively by psychotherapists to treat patients with diverse psychological symptoms, because it has been linked to more positive mood and increased feelings of well-being.</p>
            <h3>What is mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>The practice of mindfulness has become increasingly popular over the past several years. The movement has its roots in the meditative practice of Buddhism but has been progressively adapted for modern times.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Mindfulness is non-judgmental attentiveness to the present moment. It involves maintaining awareness of immediate experiences as well as maintaining an attitude of curiosity, openness and acceptance of these experiences. In simpler terms, mindfulness is paying attention to present moment experiences without trying to alter anything.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">In a mindful state, we are fully conscious of our moment-to-moment thoughts and feelings and of external stimuli, rather than thinking about the past or the future. For example, we would attend to how rapidly or deeply we are breathing, any pain sensations, or sounds in the environment.</p>
          <p class="bold">Mindfulness meditation has numerous positive effects on the mind and body.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">While it may seem simple to sit and relax for a few minutes, it is hard work to concentrate on the present moment without your thoughts sliding back into past regrets or worries about the future. The extra effort is worth it, as the list of mindfulness benefits is extensive.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Mindfulness can reduce stress-induced activation of the <a href="mdd.html#hpa">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis </a>. Cortisol, a glucocorticoid released during activation of the stress response, is decreased when there is a decrease in HPA axis activity. While the release of cortisol is a natural response to stress, too much cortisol can have negative effects such as decreased memory function, decreased immune function and increased blood sugar levels. Mindfulness can decrease the stress response, which means lower cortisol levels in the body.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Mindfulness has also been shown to lower blood pressure and improve sleep patterns. Research has shown mindfulness-induced changes in sleep pattern are similar to those seen in people who respond positively to antidepressants. Mindfulness can also improve cognition and concentration, as well as ameliorate symptoms associated with many psychological and neurological disorders, including depression and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Research suggests that mindfulness-related psychological changes are primarily due to altered function and structure of components of the default mode network.</p>
            <h3>How does mindfulness affect the DMN?</h3>
            <p>Some effects of mindfulness on the DMN include:</p>
            <ul class="ul-list">
              <li>&#183; Increased activation and changes in gray matter in areas of the anterior cingulate cortex, &nbsp;&nbsp;which may increase cognitive functioning.</li><br>
              <li>&#183; Increased activation and increased gray matter of the hippocampus, which may improve &nbsp;&nbsp;memory functioning.</li><br>
              <li>&#183; Increased activation in areas of the prefrontal cortex, which may improve emotional &nbsp;&nbsp;control.</li><br>
              <li>&#183; Increased connectivity between the hippocampus and posterior cingulate, which may have &nbsp;&nbsp;a positive effect on memory.</li><br>
              <li>&#183; Decreased connectivity between the thalamus and other regions of the DMN, which may &nbsp;&nbsp;reduce rumination.</li><br>
            </ul>
            
            
            
            <h3 id="mindfulness-mdd">Relationship between mindfulness and depression</h3>
            <p class="bold">How does mindfulness differ from other therapeutic strategies?</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Strategies used by psychologists to treat depression are often based on reappraisal, recasting a negative feeling into a more positive context. Healthy individuals are able to use cognitive reappraisal to reassess situations that were initially deemed negative. This reappraisal relies on the prefrontal cortex. Because the prefrontal cortex supports cognition, it is usually able to regulate limbic structures, which are involved in the emotional response.<br><br>
Consider the following situation:
</p>
            <p class="italic">You sit in your car waiting to make a safe turn in traffic, while a driver behind you incessantly honks the horn. Without the ability to emotionally regulate yourself, as is the case in individuals with depression, you would ruminate, or repetitively think about the stress of the situation, leading to continued negative feelings. Through cognitive reappraisal of this same event, you would consider circumstances that might have lead to the driver&#39;s behavior, such as the need to rush home to a sick child.</p>
            <p>Reappraisal techniques are based on the idea that emotional distress is problematic and needs to be cognitively altered. These strategies, however, might be maladaptive, in particular with depression, where ruminative thinking is a key symptom. Rumination is a compulsive focus on one&#39;s distress and its causes and consequences rather than possible solutions. While the use of cognitive reappraisal puts a less negative spin on the situation, it still forces the individual to go back and look at a stressful event. With depression, there is an impaired ability of the prefrontal cortex to regulate emotional information from the limbic system, so attempts to reappraise situations often lead to negative reinterpretations, perpetuating rumination and negative mood. In the case of the honking driver stressor, a negative reinterpretation might be:</p>
            <p class="italic">There were plenty of opportunities for me to make the turn but I waited too long. It&#39;s my fault and I deserved the negative reaction of the driver. </p>
            <p>Whether or not the situation in these thoughts is true, cognitive reappraisal has led to more negative thoughts as well as a reminder of the stressful event. Mindfulness does not require consideration or evaluation of the stressor. By giving attention to present moment sensations rather than judging the previous experience, the individual no longer needs to consider the other driver&#39;s true motivations, and the situation will lead to no further upset. Instead, attention would be given to how tightly the hands are gripping the wheel, or the pace of breathing.</p>
            <h3 id="mindfulness-ad">Mindfulness and Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD)</h3>
            <p>There is currently no cure for AD, nor any guaranteed way to prevent the illness. Mindfulness, however, seems to be a promising risk reduction method for AD.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Researchers are looking into the possibility of mindfulness as a way to delay or even prevent the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer&#39;s disease. MCI is the prodromal phase of AD, in which cognitive deficits exist, but have not reached the clinical manifestation of AD.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Timely intervention has been shown to improve cognition in those with MCI. This may be due to a number of factors, including slowing the process of the brain tissue atrophy that is characteristic of MCI and AD.  In particular, mindfulness may reduce damage to the hippocampus, a structure that is central to AD-related impairment. Research has demonstrated that mindfulness also reduces atrophy of the anterior portion of the corpus callosum, a region that supports bilateral integration of attention and executive function brain structures. Experienced mindfulness meditators show increased volume and functionality of this region, as opposed to individuals with MCI/AD, who have significant atrophy of this same brain area. The use of mindfulness in people with MCI might slow or prevent further atrophy of the anterior corpus callosum and other brain regions.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-remove">Mindfulness has also been shown to reduce risk factors for AD, including stress, depression and metabolic syndrome.</p>

          <h2 class="heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Major depression and Alzheimer&#39;s disease are both devastating brain disorders whose prevalence seems to be increasing.  Although a great deal of effort is focused on finding treatments for these disorders, there is no &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; for either.  The specific underlying causes of these disorders remain elusive, and treatments are therefore focused primarily on alleviating symptoms.  The default mode network may provide an alternative approach to prevention and treatment.  If the overactivation of the DMN can be reduced by lifestyle changes such as meditation, we may just have a mechanism that would reduce the incidence of depression and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p>
